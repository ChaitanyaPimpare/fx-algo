          <p>
            I started trading with big dreams, but I faced heavy losses and was
            scammed multiple times. Instead of quitting, I decided to build my
            own honest trading system.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2017, I began studying forex and algorithmic trading. After two
            years of hard work, I created my first successful robot. Today,
            that journey has grown into FXALGO, trusted by traders worldwide.
            Our mission is simple: real strategies, honest systems, and reliable
            results.
